# Square-Trap-Game-v1.1.0-beta
This is my first more-or-less serious project, and I decided to code it in Javascript! Level 2 was finished yesterday, Level 1 will get redesigned, and Level 3 is in development.

As you might've already figured out, this game is a browser game, so just start a Live Server in Visual Studio Code using the Live Server extension.
